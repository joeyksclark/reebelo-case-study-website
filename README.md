# ReebeloCaseStudyWebsite
Welcome to the Full Stack Case Study Project for Reebelo

In this time-constrained project, I present a case study designed for evaluating full-stack developer candidates at Reebelo. While this project may contain many TODOs, it serves as a platform for making informed design decisions and ultimately delivering a fully functional product. I look forward to discussing those decisions and considerations I would make under different constraints.
